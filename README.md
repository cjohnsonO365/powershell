# Fantasy Football PowerShell Commandlets
Some developers double as Fantasy Football commissioners.  This repo is for you.

To run the script, add the teams in your league to the $teams array:

$teams = $("Bears", "Packers", "Lions", "Vikings", 
    "Cowboys", "Redskins", "Eagles", "Giants", 
    "Falcons", "Buccaneers", "Saints", "Panthers", 
    "Rams", "Seahawks", "49ers", "Cardinals")

Then run the script.  The draft order will be output in the console window.
